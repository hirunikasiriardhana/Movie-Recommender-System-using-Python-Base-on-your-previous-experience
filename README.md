# Movie-Recommender-System-using-Python-Base-on-your-previous-experience
The Movie Recommender System is designed to suggest movies to users based on their historical ratings. Utilizing a dataset that includes user IDs, item IDs, ratings, and timestamps, the system calculates similarity scores between movies. When a user selects a movie, the system identifies and recommends other movies that are most similar to the chosen one. This project employs item similarity-based recommendations, offering a foundational approach to developing more advanced and personalized recommendation systems. By analyzing user preferences and movie attributes, the system enhances the movie-watching experience through tailored suggestions.
